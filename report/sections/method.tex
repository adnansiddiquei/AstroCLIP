\subsection{Objective}\label{subsec:objective}
As per the original AstroCLIP implementation~\citep{astroclip}, the objective of this piece of work was to embed galaxy
spectra and galaxy images into a shared latent space using a multi-modal contrastive learning approach.
This follows on naturally from the assumption that two modalities are different physical representations of the same
underlying object, and as such should be able to be represented in a shared, lower dimensional space.
The same loss function was used as in the oriig
