# Training Statistics

This directory contains the Jupyter notebook and scripts used to generate the results and plots for the training
statistics in Section (5) of the report.
You do not need to run anything in this folder, but WandB logs, script and notebook have been left here for completeness.
[`wandb_logs/`](wandb_logs) contains the output logs from WandB for the training runs used in the paper.
They have been pre-processed with the `_reformat_wadb_logs.py`.
